# MultiGridMethod

A project for the Specialized Master in HPC-AI from Mines Paris.

In the context of a Distributed Linear Algebra and indirect resolution of linear systems, we developed a multigrid method. This method is widely used in the resolution of linear systems from numerical simulations, using a hierarchy of discretizations. Here, we applied it to solve differential equations from a 2D Poisson problem.

The jupyter notebook explains the problem, the code for the method and an analysis of the results.
